# Parsons Problems Web App

This project is an interactive web application for solving Parsons Problems—drag-and-drop coding puzzles where you arrange code blocks (including distractors) into the correct order to solve a programming task.

## Features

- Multiple Parsons Problems with adaptive hints (distractors are removed after incorrect attempts)
- Drag-and-drop interface for arranging code blocks
- Progress is saved per problem
- Personalized certificate of completion at the end
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your name to personalize your experience.
3. For each problem:
    - Drag code blocks from "Available Code" to "Your Solution" and arrange them in the correct order.
    - Click "Check Solution" to verify your answer.
    - If incorrect, a distractor block will be removed to help you.
    - Use "Previous" and "Next" to navigate between problems.
4. After solving all problems, you will receive a certificate of completion, which you can print.
